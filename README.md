# React Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge

## Overview

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is developed using React and demonstrates the use of state management, conditional rendering, and React hooks as part of the "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)" course. The game includes a single-player mode against a simple AI and a two-player mode for gameplay between two individuals.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**: Play in a _two-player mode_ against another person or in a _single-player mode_ against a basic AI.
- **Customizable Player Names**: Allows players to set and change their names during the game.
- **Responsive Game Board**: Interactive game board that updates based on player actions.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the game outcome with an option to restart.
- **Move History Log**: Records and shows a log of all moves made during the game.

## Additional Enhancements

- **AI Mode**: An AI opponent feature for the single-player mode was independently added. This AI makes random moves, offering a basic level of challenge and allowing for solo gameplay.
- **Win Count Tracking**: Keeps track of and displays the number of wins for each player.
